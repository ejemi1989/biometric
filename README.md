Creating a deep learning-based facial recognition and biometric attendance system for a school would involve several steps:

Collect and preprocess data: You would need to collect a large dataset of images of the students' faces, along with biometric data such as fingerprints or iris scans. You would then need to preprocess the data to ensure that it is suitable for training a deep learning model. This may involve resizing the images, aligning the faces, and normalizing the data.

Train the model: Next, you would need to train a deep learning model to recognize the students' faces and biometric data. This could be done using a convolutional neural network (CNN) or some other type of deep learning model. You would need to split the data into training and validation sets, and use the training set to optimize the model's parameters through backpropagation and gradient descent.

Evaluate the model: Once the model has been trained, you would need to evaluate its performance on the validation set to determine how well it can recognize the students' faces and biometric data. You can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to measure the model's performance.

Deploy the model: After the model has been trained and evaluated, you can deploy it in a real-time attendance system. This might involve integrating the model into a web or mobile application that students can use to check in and out of class, or setting up a camera and biometric scanner at the school's entrance to automatically track attendance.

It's worth noting that building a deep learning-based facial recognition and biometric attendance system can be a complex task, and it may require expertise in machine learning and deep learning, as well as knowledge of relevant technologies and frameworks. You may want to consider working with a team of experts or seeking guidance from machine learning professionals to ensure that your system is accurate and reliable.
